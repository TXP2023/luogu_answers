This is a self-introduction file.

Hello, I am TXP2023, the owner of this repository. This repository holds my AC (Accepted) codes from the computer learning website www.luogu.com.cn. Most of the codes in this repository are written in C/C++. Additionally, the majority of the codes are authored by myself, and those that are not will be specifically noted. I hope that the codes in this repository can assist you in your learning or serve as a reference. At the same time, I do not condone plagiarism.

However, my English is not very good, so the meaning of this part in English may be different from what I want to express
